                Data Engineers are the data professionals who prepare the “big data” infrastructure 
                to be analyzed by Data Scientists. They are software engineers who design, build, 
                integrate data from various resources, and manage big data. Then, they write complex 
                queries on that, make sure it is easily accessible, works smoothly, and their goal is
                 optimizing the performance of their company’s big data ecosystem.
            </p>

           <h2>data analyst</h2>
            <p>
                Data Analysts are experienced data professionals in their organization who can 
                query and process data, provide reports, summarize and visualize data. They have a 
                strong understanding of how to leverage existing tools and methods to solve a problem, 
                and help people from across the company understand specific queries with ad-hoc reports 
                and charts.
            </p>

           <h2>data scientist</h2>
            <p>
            A data scientist is a professional responsible for collecting, analyzing and 
            interpreting extremely large amounts of data. The data scientist role is an offshoot 
            of several traditional technical roles, including mathematician, scientist, statistician 
            and computer professional.
