                <h2>Data Science vs. Computer Science: The Basics</h2>

                <p>
                    To begin, let’s explore the fundamental differences between these two computer careers. Computer science is the older of the two subjects, dating back hundreds of years. In fact, the first “computer programmer,” Ada Lovelace, lived in the early 1800s—over a hundred years before the first modern computer was created. On the other hand, data science is a relatively new field in technology that has grown as businesses and organizations seek to put the massive amounts of data they collect to good use.

                    Computer Science is the study of the theory and practice of how computers work. “When you earn a degree in Computer Science, you learn programming, software, operating systems, algorithms and everything needed to run a computer,” says Nirupama Mallavarupu, founder of MobileArq. “You learn to solve problems using technology.”
                    
                    Those who study Computer Science learn programming languages such as Python®, JavaScript® and Java® as well as the fundamental elements that make these languages work. In school, topics such as operating systems, networking, security, algorithms and computer architecture are taught as well. Overall, computer science focuses solely on computers.
                    
                    Data science isn’t as clear cut; it’s an interdisciplinary field involving computer science and statistics. Statistical analysis is nothing new, but the scale of the data sets and computing power needed for analysis certainly are.
                    
                    “Data science is an advanced discipline that teaches students how to analyze and find patterns in large amounts of data,” Mallavarupu says.
                    
                    In data science, data is gathered (or mined) and analyzed for any valuable insights, trends or patterns. Those in a data science field use programming languages such as R, SAS, Python® and Java®, and software such as Hadoop, Tableau and Apache Spark to process, refine and display their findings. Data Science degrees focus on mathematical concepts and understanding, such as calculus and statistics. Other subjects such as machine learning, deep learning, data visualization and databases are also covered.

               <h2>Data Science vs Computer Science: Job titles</h2>
                <p>
                    If you’re trying to determine which field to study, it’s good to know about the job titles you’d potentially qualify for in your career. After all, you don’t really see many people walking into work with the job title computer scientist, so let’s shed some light on what’s actually out there. To help with this, we used real-time data analysis to find the top job titles for those who have earned a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science.1 The most common job titles seeking Computer Science degree are: Software development engineer, software developer, Java® developer, systems engineer and network engineer.

                    Those who work in the field of data science may have titles such as data scientist, data architect, data engineer, business analyst and data analyst.

                <h2>Data science vs. computer science: Common job duties</h2>          
                <p>
                    In general, computer science jobs revolve around building, modifying and digging into the inner workings of software applications. Data science jobs are a bit more abstract—often their work revolves around attempting to improve a process or answer an unknown by pulling together huge amounts of information from multiple sources and analyzing it.
